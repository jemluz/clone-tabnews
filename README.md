# Want to build a REAL LIFE OPEN SOURCE project??

So let's develop [TabNews](https://github.com/filipedeschamps/tabnews.com.br) from zero!

## What is Tabnews?

The¬†[Tabnews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/)¬†is a website forum focused on the technology community, aimed at debates and exchanging knowledge through publications and comments created by the users themselves. Its contents include articles, news, tutorials and more.

## And why is that a big deal?

As it is a real project, it's a huge experience in software engineering. Dealing with large volumes of data such as

### > `180K visitors` | > `900K views` | > `80K publications`

### All with around 30K lines of code, from zero to production!

# Real life project with real life metrics

Three months after TabNews's official launch, `500K people` were already visiting it, totaling `3 million` views of its content. With `27K people` registered and `8.2K publications` and `34K responses/interactions`, forming one of the friendliest and most engaged communities on the web.

In addition to the support of 50 contributors in the open source project repository. And with 3 thousand stars on GitHub.

And it also ranked very well in Google analytics, reaching almost 60K clicks in 30 days, a jump of 24K clicks compared to the previous period. The Google console itself reveals a growing trend of exposure of content created by Tabnews users, being exposed even for super competitive themes such as ‚ÄúGPT chat‚Äù which has already had more than 1M impressions in searches.
